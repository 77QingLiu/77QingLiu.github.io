> 2017 was a year of struggle for me as a SAS Programmer. I earn my bread mostly by using SAS, but is a SAS Programmer like me cool? That's not a stupid question.

# Looking back
In 2017, all my time and energy is spent preparing the graduate exams, studying computer science. As for working? There's no energy left to think about, but would I regret it??

in the following aspect, I
#### Data Science:
* Learn how to use data science packages on [Python](https://www.python.org/), including: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* Some Advanced Mathematics
* Some Linear Algebra
* [Probability and Mathematical Statistics] (https://book.douban.com/subject/2285151/)

#### Computer Science:
* Leaned some Python, including general Python and OOP programming, made small tools in python
* Leaned some C, mostly by the reading the excellent [The C Programming Language](https://book.douban.com/subject/1236999/)
* Also learned some data structures and algorithms by reading the [4th edition of the algorithm](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), and is burying my head in [ECNU] (http://acm.ecnu.edu.cn/problem/)

#### Working:
* From CRO to pharmaceutical company (Party A to Party B), a very challenging journey.
* Attend the PharmaSUG China 2017, submitted the paper [Streamline Table Lookup by Embedding HASH in FCMP](http://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug-cn/2017/AD/PharmaSUG-China-2017-AD02.pdf)

#### Others:
* Take the National Graduate Examination to pursuit a master degree, target schoold is [East China Normal University] (http://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) (Update: **Pass the passing line and waiting for retest**)
* Build my [Github portfolio](https://github.com/77QingLiu)
* Build my [personal blog](http://77qingliu.com/)
Will try to summarize my part-time graduate journey afer I enroll school successfully

# What's next
* Job interview (data science)
* Studying Part-time graduate students
* Learn machine learning and data mining theory
